## PULSE OXIMETER STUDY MODULES – ABG ANALYSIS (GEM OPERATION)
The ABG ANALYSIS volunteer is responsible for the processing and analysis of blood draw samples through the GEM machine. Arterial blood gases are measured from the collected blood samples through the machine, which are printed, labeled and sent to the supervisor/study’s recorder. The GEM operator can be a non-MD volunteer.

## RESPONSIBILITIES
    • Retrieving blood samples in a timely manner 
    • Process blood samples through GEM machine
    • Labeling printouts and handing them to the study’s recorder
    • Communicating with Medi Collection and Recorder

## STEP-BY-STEP HOW TO
    1. Retrieve blood sample from Medi Collection or ice box
        ◦ Because blood samples can be kept on ice for a maximum of 30 minutes, communicate any backlogs in processing
    2. Process blood samples through the GEM machine
        ◦ “Start new sample” Tab
            ▪ “Select Panel” --> ABG Plus
            ▪ “Type” --> Arterial 
            ▪ Start
        ◦ Feed sample to needle for aspiration
        ◦ “Input information” Tab
            ▪ Enter Participant ID
            ▪ Enter Operator ID (Scan Medi Collection ID; i.e. Tanya)
            ▪ Set temperature from vitals 
        ◦ Processing and analysis of sample will take approximately 5 minutes 
            ▪ Errors will cause restart (2 mins)
        ◦ “View results” Tab
            ▪ Results should automatically print
            ▪ Otherwise press “Print”
    3. Collect GEM Printout
        ◦ Wait for printout to finish printing
        ◦ Collect printout and label sample number at the top
    4. Hand-over labeled GEM Printout to supervisor for checking ABGs
