What does a Glia project look like?

**Phase 1** – Device Design & Prototype Creation
After deciding on a project that both addresses a need and is within our capabilities, the device design begins. Many cycles of design, redesign and prototyping go into the refinement process. This is often the shortest phase.

**Phase 2** – Research & Ethics Board Application, Experimental Calibration & Validation
The design is further refined and validated through approved experimentation.

**Phase 3** – Health Canada Approval, Publication
The device works but needs Health Canada approval to function as an accepted medical device. Studying the device ensures that we have a quality product that is proven to do what we claim. This process is often the longest.

**Phase 4** – Assembly Instruction, Knowledge Translation & Product Development/Dissemination
The device is safe, it works, and we know it. Time to get it into the hands of the people! This is an ongoing process of knowledge translation and dissemination.
