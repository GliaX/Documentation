title: What does a Glia project look like?
---


**Phase 1 – Device Design & Prototype Creation**<br>
After deciding on a project that both addresses a need and is within our capabilities, the device design begins. Many cycles of design, redesign and prototyping go into the refinement process. This is often the shortest phase.

**Phase 2 – Research & Ethics Board Application, Experimental Calibration & Validation**<br>
The design is further refined and validated through approved experimentation.

**Phase 3 – Health Canada Approval, Publication**<br>
The device works but needs Health Canada approval to function as an accepted medical device. Studying the device ensures that we have a quality product that is proven to do what we claim. This process is often the longest.

**Phase 4 – Assembly Instruction, Knowledge Translation & Product Development/Dissemination**<br>
The device is safe, it works, and we know it. Time to get it into the hands of the people! This is an ongoing process of knowledge translation and dissemination.
