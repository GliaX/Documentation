## Prepare the bed
Start by removing all visible debris from the bed and flexible steel sheet and ensuring that there are no leftover printed parts.

Place the steel sheet onto the bed in the correct position. The back two indents should be pushed and the sheet should appear straight on the heating bed.

### PLA and ABS
For prints using PLA or ABS, you only need to clean the bed with Isopropyl Alcohol. This should be 99% to avoid leaving residue or water on the bed.

### PETG
Adhesion between the plastic on the spring steel sheet ([PEI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyetherimide) and PETG is so strong that there has to be a separating agent put in between the two.

After cleaning with Isopropyl Alcohol, use a separating agent such as glass cleaner (commonly called Windex). Other separating agents include [PVA glue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyvinyl_acetate) such as most [glue sticks](https://www.amazon.ca/s?k=pva+glue+stick) and [liquid glue](https://www.amazon.ca/s?k=pva+glue).

## Clean the nozzle
Remove any remaining ooze from the nozzle. Careful that the nozzle might be hot.

## Insert the SD card into the printer
Insert the SD card into the printer, which should be detected by the printer.

## Start the print
Enter the printer menu by pushing on the knob and then turning it to select "Print from SD". Select your working G Code file. If you don't see your G Code file, remove the card and check on your computer that it was properly copied.

## Watch the first layer
The first layer is the foundation upon which the rest of the print will be built. Watch your entire first layer to ensure that it is good. Here's what you're watching out for:

* **Adhering to bed**: Ensure that the first layer is sticking properly to the bed.

* **Not too low**: The nozzle shouldn't be etching into the plastic sheet on the bed.

* **Objects don't overlap**: Objects should have space between them, which can be missed during slicing. Double-check this during the first layer.

## Adjust live Z if needed
If the nozzle is too close to the bed or too far away, you can make adjustments by going into the menu and selecting "Live Z adjustment". Lower numbers will draw the nozzle closer to the bed. Higher numbers will move the nozzle further from the bed. Make small adjustments and watch the nozzle to ensure it's doing what you expect.
