title: Who are We?

Glia is a non-profit organization dedicated to using an open-access research, development and distribution model to create high-quality low-cost medical devices that are then clinically validated. 
We want to change the way people interact with their devices. Providing communities with open-access low-cost medical devices fosters a culture of self-reliance and sustainability. 
If low-resource communities can access the equipment they need via an open-access model, they are empowered to troubleshoot problems, customize designs to meet their needs and share their findings with others. 
The ability to share successes in an open-access environment allows medical and technical communities to work together and avoid duplication of work and long feedback cycles. 
This model allows off-patent devices to exist as high-quality low-cost generic models, which also exerts downward pressure on prices for high-quality premium brands.
