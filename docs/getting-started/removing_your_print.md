title: Removing your print

## Let it cool
Let the plate cool to at least 30C before you try to remove the print. This will allow the plastic to harden and make removal easier.

## Remove the steel sheet from the bed
The sheet is connected to the bed by magnets. Remove the sheet by pulling directly upward to remove it from the magnetic field, and then pull it off the bed.

## Gently flex the plate
This is a spring steel sheet, but it can be deformed by aggressive bending. Gently flex the plate inward and outward from the various angles until the part comes off.

## Clean the plate for the next use
Clean the plate for the next usage. If you place the plate on the bed, ensure it is correctly positioned and that you have prepared it with isopropyl alcohol. If you are using PETG, remember to add glass cleaner.
