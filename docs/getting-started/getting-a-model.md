title: Getting a model to print
---

Slicers are a way to turn a 3D model into 2D "slices". You still have to start with a 3D model. In this short chapter, we will list some of the popular locations for getting models. We've copied some content directly from [Lulzbot's page on model repositories](https://www.lulzbot.com/content/3d-model-repositories).

Go ahead and grab a model that interests you from any of the repositories.

## Thingiverse
* **URL:** [https://thingiverse.com](https://thingiverse.com)
* **Pros:** The OG site for models
* **Cons:** Originally owned by Makerbot and now Stratsys. Has a difficult relationship with the community

## YouMagine
* **URL** [https://youmagine.com/](https://youmagine.com/)
* **Pros:** Has a large amount of 3D models, and a community originally established around the European community of 3D printer users.
* **Cons:** None for now.

## MyMiniFactory
* **URL**: [https://www.myminifactory.com/](https://www.myminifactory.com/)
* **Pros:** Some paid models that are high quality and not accessible otherwise
* **Cons:** More commercially focused

## Yeggi
* **URL**: [https://yeggi.com/](https://yeggi.com/)
* **Pros:** More of a 3D model search engine/index that gathers models from many of the online 3D model communities.
* **Cons:** A bit hard to find things and navigate around.
