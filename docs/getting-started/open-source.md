title: What is Free/Libre and Open Source medicine?
---

The philosophy behind free/libre and open source sharing is part of Glia’s foundation, here you’ll understand the intentions that direct why Glia does what it does. 
Free and libre refers to free licensing where anyone can use, copy, distribute, and change the source code/file; this is possible through open source sharing where the source code/file is shared openly to everyone. 
More importantly, free/libre and open source sharing deviates from proprietary licensing that dominates the mainstream. 
Instead of a culture of competition, a culture of collaboration drives the free and open source movement. While working counter to capitalist ideals can sometimes put us in a pinch, integrity to the idea of “people helping people” liberates and guides us through decision making.
