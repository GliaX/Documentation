title: Setting up your software
---

In this chapter, you will learn how to install an [open source slicer](https://slic3r.org/) and set it up. This guide is specific to Glia's equipment, but should be applicable in other situations too.

## Get the software
For this guide, we will use the [Prusa Edition of Slic3r](https://www.prusa3d.com/slic3r-prusa-edition/), though [the regular Slic3r](https://slic3r.org) also works well and should be usable.

Start by downloading the software from the site below:
* [https://github.com/prusa3d/Slic3r/releases](https://github.com/prusa3d/Slic3r/releases)

### GNU/Linux
* Download the AppImage file.
* Make the file executable like so: `chmod +x <filename>.AppImage`
* If you are using Ubuntu, right click on the AppImage file, select properties and enable execution.
* Start the program by double-clicking on it or executing from commandline.

### Mac OSX
* Get the dmg file
* Install the files inside it

### Windows
* Get the win64 zip (unless you know you need win32).
* Launch the executable inside

## Start Slic3rPE
Once the software is installed, go ahead and start up Slic3rPE.
