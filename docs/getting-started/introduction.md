The goal of this chapter is to get you familiar with 3D printing, to help you set up the printing software, and to get you on your way to your first print.

This chapter is meant to be a companion to an in-person session with members of the Glia team, but it should be useful as a standalone. If you have suggestions on how to make it better, [file an issue in our repository](https://github.com/gliax/documentation/issues) or propose a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) if you're so inclined.

If you would like to know more about the Glia project, visit us [at our web page](https://glia.org) or [send us an email at info@glia.org](mailto:info@glia.org).
