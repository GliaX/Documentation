The pulse oximeter is a device that allows for the noninvasive measurement of an individualâ€™s oxygen saturation. While there are many inexpensive pulse oximeters on the market, their quality is low, and they have not been validated. Developing a low cost, accurate pulse oximeter validated for clinical practice will improve access to safe care by bringing this valuable device to more of the people who need it. 

The open source pulse oximeter began pilot studies in the fall of 2019. Health Canada approved phase 1 trials are on hold due to the COVID-19 pandemic but will soon resume at Victoria Hospital, London ON, Canada. These trials seek to develop calibration curves and reinforce patient safety.
