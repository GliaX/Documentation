**Stage of development:** Phase 4 <br>
**Team:** Tarek Loubani, Alex Pavlosky, Steve Plimmer


Modelling off the 1963 Littmann design whose patent expired decades ago, we created a stethoscope that performs on par with the Cardiology III at a cost of $2.83 USD. To reduce cost, 3D printers are used to create several parts including the stethoscope head, Y-piece, spring and ear tubes. This device has been validated in a peer-reviewed publication. In Canada, it is produced by Glia as a Class I device. Glia holds a Medical Device Establishment License from Health Canada.


In its ongoing phase 4 the stethoscope is being deployed in Canada and internationally, reaching the hands of medical professionals and learners alike. 
Currently, our teams are establishing relationships with healthcare professionals and learner groups to share our ethos and demonstrate the quality of the stethoscope. Medical professionals who have relied on premium brand counterparts are making the switch and realizing the potential devices like these can have for sustainable and self-reliant healthcare.
As well, we are getting feedback on the stethoscope that would not otherwise be possible without going free and open source. Individuals sharing their contributions to the design gives the project life outside of Glia.
