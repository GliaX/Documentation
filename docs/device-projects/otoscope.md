**Stage of Development:** Phase 3 <br>
**Team:** Frankie Talarico

The otoscope gives essential information on the ear canal, ear drum and surrounding structures during hearing evaluations. Alternatives to premium brand otoscopes exist, but the quality of most low-cost devices is low, and these devices tend to be difficult to use. The open source otoscope fills the gap as a high quality premium device at a fraction of the cost. To reduce the cost from upwards of USD$1000 to USD$15, 3D printers are used to create several parts, including the otoscope head, body, and battery compartment. 

The otoscope is currently being field tested and distributed online. <br>
Research validation is required.
