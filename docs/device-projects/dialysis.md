The dialysis machine aims to remove excess water, solutes and toxins from the blood of patients to manage metabolic imbalances when the body cannot. Hemodialysis is life-saving management for patients worldwide suffering from kidney failure, and thus are highly sought after in high and low-resource settings alike. However, the high cost of hemodialysis machines is in part responsible for the kidney health disparity between high- and low-income countries, emphasizing the need for low-cost high-quality dialysis care equipment. 

Started in 2019, background research on the device is ongoing.
