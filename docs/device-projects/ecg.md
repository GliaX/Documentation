The electrocardiogram records the electrical activity of the heart and thus a fundamental diagnostic tool. Despite recent advances in bringing more affordable ECGs to market, there still exists a shortage in low-resource settings not met by the devices currently available. The Glia model aims to address this need as a low-cost high-quality option. 

The prototype of the ECG has been completed and will soon begin Health Canada approved phase 1 clinical trials. These trials seek to validate the device and compare it to the gold standard 12-lead ECG device (MAC 5500 HD Resting ECG System, GE Medical Systems) used in the standard of care at LHSC emergency departments.
