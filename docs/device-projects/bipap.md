**Stage of Development:** Phase 4 Version 1. Version 1 Withdrawn; Phase 1 Version 2.<br>

The **Aerosol-Reducing Mask (ARM)** was designed in response to the challenge of safely administering high-flow oxygen and Non-Invasive Positive Pressure Ventilation (e.g. BiPAP, CPAP) during the COVID-19 pandemic. In comparison to NIPPV, the ARM successfully and dramatically decreases air leak and dispersion of potentially virulent aerosolized particles. <br>

The danger of aerosolized virulent particles to HCWs and other patients became more evident during the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in the assembly of a team of engineers and HCWs to develop the ARM System. Unlike current in-hospital equipment used during administration of high-flow O2 and NIPPV, the ARM seals tightly around the entire face. When used in conjunction with a viral filter (DAR filter), this contains virulent particles within the sealed area of the mask in order to protect HCWs and other patients.


It is useful for patients who have, or are suspected of having, an infection that can be spread through aerosolized particles (eg. COVID19, Tuberculosis, SARS, Influenza). The ARM can also be used to protect others during patient transport, or when a patient cannot be isolated. 


There is currently a clinical trial underway in London, Ontario (LHSC). A satellite trial will be starting shortly in Sioux Lookout (SLMHC).


Currently, the ARM has Health Canada Class II Authorization (#314674) for clinical use, issued May 11 (2020). The device (Version 1 was withdrawn in November 2020 after clinical trials and bench testing showed the device to be ineffective in reducing aerosolization and may lead to significant levels of carbon dioxide rebreathing if used in unsupervised or minimally supervised settings.
