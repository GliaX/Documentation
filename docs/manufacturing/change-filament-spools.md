Waste during the 3D printing process has long been a problem. [An initiative](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtdcciXnfM8) spearheaded by [Richard Horne](https://twitter.com/RichRap3D) (_aka_ RichRap) kicked off a flurry of activity that culminated in most major filament manufacturers offering coils of filament without the spools. [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeJo-kKBtLk) by [Thomas Sanladerer](https://toms3d.org) is a good explainer.

## 3D printed master spool
The 3D printed master spool can be found on thingiverse, and can be printed in PLA or PETG.
