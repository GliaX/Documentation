title: Mini-Project Management
---

When starting mini-projects, the following framework is recommended to keep projects on task, organized and timely. This loose skeleton first began with the onboarding mini-project and has been fine-tuned through its implementation with other mini-projects.

1. **Assign project leads** – these individuals will be responsible for the completion of the mini-project by the given date
1. **Determine project goals and task points** – brainstorm with your team to set goals and assign tasks
1. **Track project logistics** – using Kanboard, keep track of the mini-project tasks and keep the team updated of major progress at general meetings.
