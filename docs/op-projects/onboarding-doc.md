title: Onboarding & Docusaurus
---

**Team:** Carrie Wakem, Vicky Vo, Reidun Garapick, Dave Leonard, Zack Muqtadir 

A redesign of the onboarding framework was done in 2020, with a shift to utilizing Docusaurus as the central hub of information. Using Github, Docusaurus is an open source site generator that houses this manual to getting started as a Glia team member. While anyone may make edits to the site through our GitHub, changes will need to be approved.
