title: How can we collaborate?
---

An important aspect of Glia is our culture of collaboration which runs deep in our open source philosophy and through our daily operations.
Over the years we have developed infrastructure and expertise for the development of our devices/models, and we hope to share our knowledge and skills. <br>


While there are many worthy projects to pursue, we are not able to do them all, but we hope to help in whatever way we can. Successful projects like the otoscope, demonstrate the significance in collaboration across teams to reach a common goal of getting low-cost, high quality devices into the hands of people.
