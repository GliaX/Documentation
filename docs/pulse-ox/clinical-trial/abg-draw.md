## Setup of arterial blood gas
Check the [documentation](https://docusaurus.io) for how to use Docusaurus.

## Blood draws from the arterial line

1. Remove the white cap from the stopcock that is most distal on the arterial line tubing.
2. Insert the vaccutainer adapter into the open port.
3. Fill one waste tube to remove the saline solution and ensure your blood results aren't skewed.
4. Withdraw 0.5 mL of blood in a blood gas syringe.
5. Turn the stopcock to the full OFF to transducer position and allow the syringe to fill.
6. Once it is full, turn the stopcock to the NEUTRAL position.
7. Place blood gas syringe on ice if it is not processed immediately.
8. The artline must now be flushed so that no clots develop in the tubing. Pull the blue tongue until the blood clears the tubing.
9. You should also clear the stopcock access port using the same method. Turn the stopcock 'off' to the patient on the distal stopcock. 	 
10. Pull the blue tongue to clear the access port of all blood. (You may want to hold some clean gauze under and behind the port to catch the spillage.) 	 
11. Turn the stopcock back to the NEUTRAL position.
12. Replace the white cap on the stopcock.
